PYTHON BASICS ASSIGNMENT
CampusPe – Modules 1 to 6

Name: Lavanya R
Course: Python Programming
Assignment: Python Basics (20 Questions)

Questions Attempted:
I have attempted all 20 questions from Q1 to Q20.

Programming Approach:

1. All programs are written using basic Python concepts only.
2. Used simple variables, loops (while/for), and if-else conditions.
3. Functions are used where required (Q18, Q19, Q20).
4. No use of list, tuple, set, or dictionary.
5. No advanced Python libraries were used.
6. All calculations are done manually using basic operators.
7. Input validation is handled using try-except blocks wherever required.
8. Code is written in beginner-friendly format with clear variable names.
9. Comments are added in every program to explain the logic.

Special Instructions Followed:

* Each question is written separately and clearly.
* Edge cases like division by zero, negative numbers, invalid inputs are handled.
* Step-by-step logic is used instead of shortcuts.
* No advanced built-in functions are used.
* Programs are tested with multiple inputs before submission.

Challenges Faced:

1. Writing logic without using lists or dictionaries was challenging.
2. Implementing word frequency without dictionary required extra effort.
3. Handling edge cases in number system functions required careful testing.
4. Managing long menu-based programs needed proper structure.

Learning Outcome:

Through this assignment, I improved my understanding of:
* Loops and conditions
* Functions
* Input validation
* Mathematical logic
* Writing clean and readable beginner-level code

Thank You
